### on cloning

 (this is possible beacause collaborators have push authentication granted for the project repo)

- In good practice, branches have the format of ```git chechout -B <NAME-OF-PARTNER/FEATURE-EDITED>```

 4. Partner B commits the changes and pushes. ```git push origin <BranchName>```
 5. Partner B goes to github repo on Github and choose create a pull request.
 6. Partner B gives a detailed description of the added feature and confirms to create a pull request.
